# Data-Visualization-

This is project was inspired by an article on FreeCodeCamp (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-secret-to-being-a-top-developer-is-building-things-d3d058e4e472). It deals with data visualization using NodeJS, ReactJs and Recharts, the dataset used can be found at (https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets), the data chose for this project is from the Sports sub-section.


Please note that this is still currently a WIP, this project will be developed during my sparetime as a way of self improvement.
